# Part 2

## Overall Guidance 
Target Audience: Developers, System Architects

Goal: Show how to implement semantic solutions and to achieve semantic interoperability

Give an overview of strengths when using semantic technologies.

Abstractions, hiding some aspects to make applications easier (but keeping key advantages).

Introduce existing tools, how they can be applied.

Point to relevant standard.

Show a small, but relevant example, e.g. cross-domain.

## Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to interconnect, at massive
scale, numerous sensors, devices, gateways, and systems to tackle
many challenges in the industry. 

Such inter-connectivity will
play an essential part in designing industrial systems with added
value services which are more energy efficient with lower costs
while contributing to a better environment. These promises promoted
by the emergence of the industrial Internet of Things have surged the importance of interoperability among the things
to turn this vision into reality.
Designing IoT applications requires a shared understanding of
the exchanged data among those connected things. Semantic technology,
is one of the most promising fields in the knowledge representation
domain, expected to enable interoperability in the IoT.
TheWorld WideWeb Consortium (W3C) defines a set of standards ,
such as RDF, OWL and SPARQL, to represent semantics
and query linked data, offering an ideal ecosystem and opportunity
to tackle the heterogeneity challenge in the IoT. In industrial environments
and automation domains, semantic technology has been
used to solve data interoperability issues and to provide
context aware applications and services.

Despite its potential and promises, semantic technology and
ontology-based IoT applications still remain in the hands of a minority,
the ontology experts, being too difficult to be adopted and
applied by industrial practitioners. We attribute such retention
among other factors to the absence of adequate methodology and
tools involving several major actors participating in the design life cycle
of an IoT application, who are typically non-ontology experts.

## Problem

### Developer experience
- Most tools assume users are ontology experts
- When a developer need to instantiate an ontology model, what available tools and frameworks they have available
