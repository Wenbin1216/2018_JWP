# Ontology Selection / Creation [Amelie Gyrard]

## How to find suitable ontologies?

There are numerous ontology catalogs to find existing ontologies. The most popular are:
- Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) designed by the Semantic Web community. This catalog is highly maintained and references ontology fitting their best practices criteria (e.g., ontology metadata).
 
  LOV tool: http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/

- Linked Open Vocabularies for Internet of Things (LOV4IoT) references more than 440 ontology-based projects relevant for IoT. It covers more than 20 domains: IoT, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Web of Things (WoT), smart home, smart energy, healthcare, smart city, robotics, etc. LOV4IoT is highly maintained and references more and more ontology-based projects and new domains are covered.

- OpenSensingCity, an ontology catalog for smart cities. This catalog might be not maintained anymore after the end of the project (ANR french project).
  
  OpenSensingCity tool: http://ci.emse.fr/opensensingcity/ns/ontologies/

- Ready4SmartCities, an ontology catalog for smart cities. It seems it is not maintained anymore. 
  
  Ready4SmartCities tool: http://smartcity.linkeddata.es/

We recommend to look first at ontologies supported by standardizations (e.g., W3C SOSA, SAREF, W3C WoT, ONeM2M, etc.).

Limitations: Indeed, we would need some ontology ranking algorithms to help better developers find suitable ontologies for their needs.


Comments:
We can reuse well-written paragraphs about ontology catalogs from this paper (third revision ongoing) if needed: Building IoT based applications for Smart Cities: How can ontology catalogs help? [Gyrard et al. IEEE IoT Journal 2017] (Impact Factor 7.5)

## How to extend ontologies?
TO DO

Import ontologies

Reuse ontology namespace

show concrete code example?

## How to create ontologies?
Protege is one of the most popular software to learn how to create ontologies. Protégé provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to design and develop ontologies. You can either set up Protege on your computer or use the web collabative Protege tool.

Protege tool: https://protege.stanford.edu/

A set of pointers to develop your first ontology:
- Protégé Tutorial [Horridge et al. 2011] – Design the Pizza ontology. Check if there is a more recent documentation.
