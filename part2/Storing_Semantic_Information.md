# Storing Semantic Information [Aitor Corchero Rodiguez]
> How to store semantic information, making it accessible for later processing.

Commonly, semantic information is stored in triple or quad stores. The first step before storing the information is to select most suitable triple or quad stores depending on the type of inferences and the expected size of the information we planned to store. To perform this initial task, it is common to analyse triple/quad stores benchmarks. Several benchmarks are being collected and published by W3C[^https://www.w3.org/wiki/RdfStoreBenchmarking]. This Wiki pages collects W3C performed benchmarks considering different ontologies (BSBM, LUBM, UOBM, SIB, DBpedia Benchmark, etc). Moreover, it also collects third parties benchmarks. The latest benchmarks performed by the W3C corresponds to 2018 (most updated ones). As contrary, the latest third parties benchmarks are dated 2015[^http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj954.pdf]. Considering latest results, a small summary of the different triple stores are:
