# Overal Goals

- Show benefits of semantic technologies, enabling semantic interoperability
- Make use of the broad range ofexperts to provide value to the community
- Do one step towardsharmonization of approaches (recommendations, best practice)
- Do one step towards uptake ofsemantic technologies
- Bring researchers,standardization engineers and developers closer together
- Do not champion specific underlying projects, but abstract from them, try to achieve a general level,showing examples is okay

# Proposal 1

Target Audience: Standardization Engineers/ Bodies

Goal: Towards best practice in semantic interoperability

- State of the art evaluation
- Select Relevant examples
  - Criteria: coverage of design space and importance of approach (e.g. international standard may have more weight than small individual research project)
- Derive recommendations for semantic interoperability

# Proposal 2

Target Audience: Developers and System Architects

Goal: Show how to implement semantic solutions and to achieve semantic interoperability

- Give an overview of strengths when using semantic technologies.

- Abstractions, hiding some aspects to make applications easier (but keeping key advantages).

- Introduce existing tools, how they can be applied.

- Point to relevant standard.

- Show a small, but relevant example, e.g. cross-domain.
