# Part 1

Target Audience: Standardization Engineers/ Bodies

Goal: Towards best practice in semantic interoperability

- State of the art evaluation
(Select Relevant examples
  - Criteria: coverage of design space and importance of approach (e.g. international standard may have more weight than small individual research project))

- Derive recommendations for semantic interoperability

# Some suggestions 
 ## Paragraph "standards and semantic models" suggestion for Part 1 (to improve according to the needs and since standardization experts are here)
TO DO: add table (standards and semantic models) with pros and cons?

The Web of Things (WoT) is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) to ease the access to data using the benefits of Web technologies [2]. Data is generated by things/devices and then exploited by more and more web-based applications to monitor healthcare or even control home automation devices. There is a growing interest in standardization in designing models to represent devices and produced data as demonstrated by the following standards. Those models should be used to design interoperable smart web-based WoT applications:

* W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) is the first initiative to address interoperability issues to describe sensor networks through an ontology since devices are required to build WoT applications. A new version of the ontology [3] has been recently released and became a W3C recommendation in October 2017. It is a joint contribution with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard, extending and improving the SSN ontology published in 2011.

* W3C Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group is designing a vocabulary to describe interactions between objects through the Web, a potential implementation is the WoT ontology [4]. At the current date of writing, WoT ontology is not aligned with W3C SSN ontologies. A healthcare scenario has been designed "Remote health monitoring system" [5] among several use cases.

* OneM2M, an international standard for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) with the development of the OneM2M ontology [6]. It extends the European ETSI M2M standard. At the current date of writing, OneM2M is not aligned with W3C SSN. The MyOntoSens ontology, based on SSN V1 is being standardized as a Technical Specification (TS) within the SmartBAN (Body Area Networks) Technical Committee of the ETSI standardization body [Nachabe et al. 2015]. This ontology is relevant to build health applications based on smart devices.

* Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) [7], is a European standard supported by ETSI M2M and SmartM2M. It mainly covers the smart building applicative domain. The SAREF ontology has been designed re-using SSN and oneM2M according to [Moreira et al. 2017].

* Schema.org is a well-known schema catalog to structure data on Web pages to describe the location, person, etc. The IoT Schema.org extension [8] is planned; nothing concrete has been developed yet, but discussions are ongoing.

* Haystack [9] is a project aiming at standardizing semantic data models and web services. For instance, the Haystack Tagging Ontology which employs SSN V1 ontology has been developed [10] [Charpenay et al. 2015].

 ## Cross-domain use case suggestion
 
 Would Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) would be relevant?
 AAL combines smart homes and healthcare applicative domains
 AAL helps elderly people to stay independent at home.
 
  ## Add Appendix section - with technical details for developers?
  an annexe/appendix section with all technical details would satisfy the developers? and the other audience won't be lost within the document
  
  ## Derive recommendations for semantic interoperability - "Lessons Learned, Recommendations and Best Practices" 
  we can add one section "Lessons Learned, Recommendations and Best Practices" at the end of the document
  - focus on semantic models (e.g., ontologies)
  - other ideas
  - best practices checklist summary
