# Overall Guidance
Target Audience: Developers, System Architects

Goal: Show how to implement semantic solutions and to achieve semantic interoperability

Give an overview of strengths when using semantic technologies.

Abstractions, hiding some aspects to make applications easier (but keeping key advantages).

Introduce existing tools, how they can be applied.

Point to relevant standard.

Show a small, but relevant example, e.g. cross-domain.

# Introduction [???]
High-level introduction regarding semantics and purpose of this paper (also see: overall guidance above). The idea is to show developers and system architects how to implement semantic solutions. The focus of the main paper is on the different activities. We show examples of tools there, but refer to the appendix for a more detailed description of further available tools.

# Problem Description [Michelle Wetterwald]
Describe the problem space in which semantics can be applied in more detail.

# Example Use Case [Laura Daniele]
Describe an example use case that instantiates the problem space, is as simple as possible, but shows the advantages of semantics and can be used in the following subsections.

# Ontology Selection / Creation [Amelie Gyrard]
How to find suitable ontologies and if necessary extend or create ontologies.

# Ontology Instantiation [Charbel Kaed]
Given an ontology, how can this ontology be instantiated for a concrete use case.

# Software Implementation [Sonia Bilbao, Charbel Kaed]
Give an overview of different aspects that are needed when writing software for processing semantic information.

## Semantic Information / Semantic Annotation [???]
How to get to semantic information, e.g. based on original raw sensor data.

## Storing Semantic Information [Aitor Corchero Rodiguez]
How to store semantic information, making it accessible for later processing.

## Retrieving Semantic Information [Martin Bauer]
How to enable retrieving semantic information.

## Analytics and Reasoning using Semantic Information [???]
How to do analytics and reasoning using semantic information.

# Semantic Interoperability Across Systems [Antonio Jara]
How to achieve semantic interoperability across systems.
